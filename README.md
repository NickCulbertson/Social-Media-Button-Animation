# Free Social Media Icon Animations | Green Screen or Transparent Background
This is a set of Social Media Icon Animations with green screen or transparent background for your videos. Feel free to use them on your YouTube videos. Permission is not needed, just don't repost the full social media video files as-is or duplicate for redistribution. I hope it comes in handy!


## Features

• Multiple Social Media Button Animation Videos

• Simple Animations with Transparent Background


## Implementation

1. Navigate to the ".mov" files you want by clicking on the file name in the directory above, then select Download.

2. Import the videos into your project and assemble them however you like. (If you have multiple button click animations playing simultaneously you might choose to mute the "click" audio on all but one.)

## About Social Media Icon Animations

This project was made by request of a viewer of my subscribe templates. She asked if I'd make some social media icon animations and I did! Once again, I'm making this template Open Source because I want to empower creatives to support themselves. You've worked too hard, too long to give away control. I hope it helps make your first impression for your followers most triumphant! 


If you have any questions, suggestions, or feedback please send them my way. This is as much for me as it is for you. If you use it, send me a link! I'd love to see your work. 

Enjoy!
